# bitcheck
A real time polling app built using socket.io which alerts when the bitcoin price goes down the desired price.

## Getting started

```
git clone git@github.com:saiicharan/bitcheck.git
cd bitcheck
```

### Start the server

```
cd server
npm install
node app.js
```
This should start the server at port 4001.

### Start the client

Once the server is up and running, it's time to start the client.

```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```
Once this is done, you can see the client app running at port 3000.
